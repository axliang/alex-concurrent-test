/**
 * A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.
 * Implementors define a single method with no arguments called
 * <tt>call</tt>.
 *
 * <p>The <tt>Callable</tt> interface is similar to {@link
 * java.lang.Runnable}, in that both are designed for classes whose
 * instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A
 * <tt>Runnable</tt>, however, does not return a result and cannot
 * throw a checked exception.
